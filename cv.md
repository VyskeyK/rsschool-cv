## Code Example
**Remove First and Last Character KATA from CODEWARS:** _It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters._
```js
function removeChar(str){
    let newStr='';
    for (let i=1; i<str.length-1; i++){
        newStr += str[i];
    };
    return newStr;
};
```
